# Fake API

### Getting started

Run `bundle install`
Then simply `ruby api.rb` to start the server. (defaults to localhost:4567)

### Advanced options

This requires that you have installed [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and added it to your `$PATH`

To do that visit https://ngrok.com/download to download ngrok. Then just add a line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` like so:
```shell
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/ngrok"
```

After that feel free to run the included script with `./start.sh`.

Profit.
